# personal-goals
Hey dear Internet people! I decided to start a public repo to share my personal goals for 2017 and beyond. This will also serve as inspiration for me and for anyone else that might want to do something similar. I got the idea to do this when i saw a HN thread comment that linked to https://github.com/slashdotdash/personal-goals. Thanks dude :)

## 2017

- [Goals](https://github.com/craked5/personal-goals/milestone/1)
- [Achievements](https://github.com/craked5/personal-goals/milestone/1?closed=1)

Each goal is logged as an issue. A closed ticket represents an accomplishment.

Feel free to contribute to my goals or simply comment with a "Hi" :)
